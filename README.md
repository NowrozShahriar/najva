# Najva

**Najva** aims to become *the go-to web client for XMPP*, spreading the light of security and freedom by making XMPP more accessible — and actually usable in everyday life.


## 🚧 Current State

⚠️ *Still in early development / pre-alpha.*

-  Just made sure the UI appears perfect on mobile to desktop, and everything in between.

This is a [Phoenix LiveView](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/) project with *no database*. The library used is [ProcessOne XMPP library](https://github.com/processone/xmpp) for Erlang/Elixir.

---

🎯 **Current Roadmap:**  
- Integrate login and display chat list.
- Display previous clean-text chats properly.
- Send clean-text messages.
- Add OMEMO, to enable secure chats.
- Implement presence.

### ⚠️ Common Issues

You might run into a few errors related to missing OpenSSL or some C libraries, depending on your system setup.
Don’t panic — just copy the error and paste it into your AI assistant (like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.).
With a few terminal commands, things should be up and running smoothly.
